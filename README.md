# TTS Agent bot for Telegram
This is a code for a bot which will respond to your messages with an audio version.

In order for everything to work, you need to create two files:
1. **api_key.txt** which will contain your openai api key. It is the only thing written in the file.
2. **bot_info.py** which is created from bot_info_template.py.
